                <h2 class="text-2xl font-['Playfair_Display'] font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Understanding Different Types of Hair Extensions</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Hair extensions have revolutionized the beauty industry, offering endless possibilities for transforming your look. Whether you're seeking added length, volume, or both, understanding the various types of extensions available is crucial for making an informed decision. Let's explore the most popular options:</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Tape-In Extensions</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">Tape-in extensions are among the most popular choices for their versatility and natural appearance. These extensions consist of thin wefts with medical-grade adhesive tape attached to the base. They're applied by sandwiching your natural hair between two extension pieces, creating a secure and comfortable fit that lasts 6-8 weeks with proper care.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Fusion/Keratin Bond Extensions</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">Fusion extensions involve attaching individual strands using keratin bonds. This method offers incredible durability and the most natural movement, as each strand is individually attached to your natural hair. While they require a longer installation time, they can last up to 6 months with appropriate maintenance.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-['Playfair_Display'] font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Proper Care and Maintenance</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">The longevity of your hair extensions largely depends on how well you care for them. Here are essential maintenance tips:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                    <li class="mb-3">Use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner specifically formulated for extensions</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Brush your extensions gently using a specialized extension brush, starting from the ends and working your way up</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Avoid sleeping with wet extensions - always blow dry on a low heat setting</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Schedule regular maintenance appointments every 4-6 weeks</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-['Playfair_Display'] font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Choosing the Right Extensions for You</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Several factors should influence your choice of extensions:</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Hair Type and Texture</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">Your natural hair's texture and density play a crucial role in determining which extension method will work best. Fine hair might benefit from tape-in extensions, while thick hair can support various methods, including fusion bonds.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Lifestyle Considerations</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">Consider your daily routine and maintenance commitment. Athletes might prefer tape-ins for their security during physical activity, while those seeking a longer-term solution might opt for fusion extensions.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-['Playfair_Display'] font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Professional Installation is Key</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">While DIY options exist, professional installation is crucial for achieving the best results and protecting your natural hair. A skilled stylist will:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                    <li class="mb-3">Assess your hair's health and recommend the most suitable extension type</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Ensure proper placement for natural movement and blend</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Provide detailed care instructions and product recommendations</li>
                    <li class="mb-3">Schedule follow-up maintenance appointments</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mb-6">Remember, quality extensions are an investment in your appearance and confidence. Working with a professional ensures you get the most value from your investment while maintaining the health of your natural hair.</p>
